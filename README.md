# Interactive Acappella Database (Name TBD)

No more will acappella groups have a hard time searching for guest groups for concerts, groups for hosting, groups to collaborate with, or simply know what groups are where. 

THE FUTURE OF ACAPPELLA IS HERE!

Brought to you proudly by Andrew Athias (RIT's Eight Beat Measure alumnus, and creator of http://www.whatshouldacappellacallme.tumblr.com/)

Designed with Ruby on Rails (Ruby 2.3/Rails 5.1.4) & ReactJS

## How To Use The Database

1. Search by either the Name of the group, City, State, and/or Gender of the group.

2. If the group is in the database, then the social media information of the searched group(s) will appear including the contact email, and group website.

3. If a particular group is not included, or the listed information is incorrect, representatives of the group may add/update their group's information.
